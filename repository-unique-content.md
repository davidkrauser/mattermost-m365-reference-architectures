## Sovereign Collaboration - Unique Content

### Problem Statement

Many organizations operate in hybrid environments where both Microsoft Teams and Mattermost are essential collaboration tools. Teams serves general business communication needs, while Mattermost provides:
- Sovereign communication for classified or sensitive workflows
- Self-hosted data control for regulatory compliance
- Secure collaboration for mission-critical operations

However, requiring users to switch between separate applications creates friction, reduces productivity, and complicates workflows. Organizations need a unified experience that provides seamless access to both platforms without compromising security or data sovereignty.

### Solution Architecture

[Mattermost Mission Collaboration for M365](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-msteams-devsecops) embeds Mattermost directly within Microsoft Teams and Outlook clients, providing a single-pane-of-glass experience. Users access both Teams channels and Mattermost channels from within the Microsoft ecosystem, eliminating application switching while maintaining separate data sovereignty for each platform.

**Key Benefits:**
- Unified user experience within familiar M365 interface
- Maintained data sovereignty for sensitive Mattermost communications
- Enterprise-grade identity management via Microsoft Entra ID
- Secure, self-hosted Mattermost data with M365 accessibility

### Detailed Architecture Components

For detailed technical specifications, see the [Mattermost Server Architecture documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment-guide/server/server-architecture.html).

#### High Availability - Technical Details

Deploy Mattermost in a [cluster-based architecture](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration-guide/scale/high-availability-cluster-based-deployment.html) to ensure continued availability during outages or hardware failures. All cluster nodes must reside within the same datacenter to ensure optimal performance and consistent network latency. High availability requires redundant infrastructure across each critical component:

- **Application servers**: Scale horizontally across multiple nodes (64-bit x86 architecture) with a load balancer distributing client traffic. Servers communicate via gossip protocol for cluster coordination and leader election. All nodes must maintain identical `config.json` configurations and synchronized time via Network Time Protocol (NTP).
- **Database layer**: Use PostgreSQL master/read replica architecture with connection pooling and automatic failover. Configure read replicas to offload query traffic and search replicas for dedicated search operations. Optimize database connection limits, work memory settings, and autovacuum parameters for performance.
- **Object storage**: Configure S3-compatible backends with erasure coding or replication for durability. All application servers must access shared file storage (NAS or S3) to ensure consistent data availability.
- **Monitoring**: Deploy Prometheus and Grafana for comprehensive cluster health monitoring and performance metrics collection.

**Cluster Operations**: Rolling updates can be performed for dot releases without service interruption. Configuration changes can typically be applied without full service restarts (server restart takes approximately 5 seconds; database schema updates may require up to 30 seconds). Use environment variables for configuration management and mmctl for cluster administration.

#### Proxy Server Details

NGINX is recommended for load balancing with support for WebSocket connections, health check endpoints, and sticky sessions. The proxy layer provides SSL termination and distributes client traffic across application servers.

#### Database Optimization

For high availability, configure a master/read replica architecture with connection pooling. Optimize PostgreSQL settings including connection limits, work memory allocation, and autovacuum parameters. Support for search replicas enables dedicated database resources for search operations.

#### Object Storage Details

For high availability deployments, object storage must be shared across all application servers using network-attached storage (NAS) or S3-compatible object storage with erasure coding or replication for durability.

## Edge DDIL Operations - Unique Content

### Problem Statement

Field operations, remote deployments, and edge environments often experience Disconnected, Intermittent, and Limited (DDIL) network connectivity. Organizations need collaboration solutions that:
- Enable continued operations when internet connectivity is unavailable
- Allow users with internet access to collaborate via M365
- Allow users without internet access to collaborate via Mattermost
- Make all messages immediately available when connectivity is restored

Traditional cloud-only solutions fail in these scenarios, while fully disconnected systems don't integrate with enterprise workflows during normal operations.

### Solution Architecture

A dual-environment deployment strategy provides optimal collaboration in both connected and disconnected states:

**Connected State:**
- All users access unified Teams/Mattermost interface via [Mission Collaboration plugin](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-msteams-devsecops)
- Enterprise users collaborate with edge users seamlessly via Mattermost

**Disconnected State:**
- Users with internet access continue using M365 (Teams, Outlook, etc.)
- Users without internet access use Mattermost exclusively via native clients
- Mattermost operates independently at the edge location
- All Mattermost messages are stored locally and remain accessible

**Reconnection:**
- Internet connectivity is restored to the edge Mattermost server
- Users with internet access can again view Mattermost via Mission Collaboration plugin in Teams
- All messages sent during disconnection are immediately available

### Core Mattermost Capabilities

### Identity Provider Details

Authentication for mission users at the tactical edge requires a locally hosted identity provider to ensure authentication services remain operational during disconnected periods. Enterprise users authenticate to M365 applications using Microsoft Entra ID.

- **Local Identity Provider**: Deployed within the tactical network to provide authentication services during DDIL conditions. Recommended options include Keycloak (open-source IdP with OIDC/SAML support), Active Directory with ADFS, or OpenLDAP with an OIDC bridge. The local IdP serves as the primary authentication source for Mattermost and maintains an independent user directory that operates without internet connectivity.
- **Microsoft Entra ID**: Cloud-based identity provider for enterprise users accessing M365 services. When connectivity permits, the local IdP can federate with Entra ID to synchronize user accounts, credentials, and group memberships, ensuring consistency across enterprise and tactical environments.

### User Authentication in DDIL Environments

DDIL environments require authentication infrastructure that remains fully operational without internet connectivity. Relying solely on cloud-based identity providers such as Microsoft Entra ID creates a critical single point of failure when tactical networks become disconnected. To ensure mission users maintain authentication capabilities, deploy a locally hosted identity provider within the tactical network.

Deploy an identity solution such as Keycloak (open-source IdP with OIDC/SAML support), Active Directory with ADFS, or OpenLDAP with an OIDC bridge within the tactical network. The local IdP serves as the primary authentication source for Mattermost and maintains an independent user directory that operates without internet connectivity. When connectivity permits, the local IdP can federate with Entra ID to synchronize user accounts, credentials, and group memberships. User accounts must be provisioned in the local IdP before disconnection occurs to ensure authentication services remain available throughout DDIL conditions. See [Air-Gapped Deployment](https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment-guide/server/air-gapped-deployment.html) for detailed configuration guidance for disconnected environments.

## Mission Partner Collaboration - Unique Content

### Problem Statement

Multi-organizational collaborations face complex communication challenges:
- Different organizations use different platforms (Teams, Mattermost, Matrix)
- Some organizations use both Teams and Mattermost
- External partners need controlled access without full organizational membership
- Organizations may speak different languages
- Security and compliance requirements vary across organizations
- Standard secure communication channels (HTTPS) must be used for inter-org communication

Traditional solutions require everyone to adopt the same platform or use insecure external tools. Organizations need a flexible collaboration framework that:
- Bridges multiple communication platforms
- Provides granular access control for external users
- Enables cross-organizational communication over standard protocols
- Breaks down language barriers with automatic translation
- Maintains security and compliance standards

### Solution Architecture

A multi-layer collaboration approach addresses diverse organizational needs:

#### Layer 1: External Teams Users → Mattermost Access
Teams users from external organizations receive Mattermost guest accounts and access Mattermost via the [Mission Collaboration plugin](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-msteams-devsecops) embedded in their Teams client.

#### Layer 2: Mattermost-to-Mattermost Collaboration
Organizations with Mattermost deployments establish secure connections and share specific channels using [Connected Workspaces](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration-guide/onboard/connected-workspaces.html) over standard HTTPS.

#### Layer 3: Mattermost-to-Matrix Federation
Organizations using Matrix servers connect to Mattermost via the [Matrix bridge plugin](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-matrix-bridge) for bidirectional communication.

#### Layer 4: Automatic Language Translation
AI-powered [automatic translation](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-channel-translations) enables seamless communication across language barriers in all shared channels.

### Federation Services - Detailed Capabilities

#### Guest Accounts for External Teams Users

[Mattermost Guest Accounts Documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration-guide/onboard/guest-accounts.html)

**Capabilities:**
External Teams users access Mattermost as guests via the Mission Collaboration plugin with controlled permissions:

- **Access Control**: Guests can only access specific channels they're invited to
- **Authentication**: Support for email invitation, AD/LDAP, or SAML 2.0
- **User Identification**: Guests are marked with "GUEST" badge
- **Allowed Actions**: Pin messages, use slash commands, favorite channels, update profile
- **Restrictions**: Cannot invite others, create DMs outside assigned channels, or join open teams

**Management:**
- System admins control who can invite guests
- Admin ability to promote/demote guest roles
- Individual guest account controls
- Guest accounts count as paid users

#### Cross-Organization Mattermost Collaboration

[Connected Workspaces Documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration-guide/onboard/connected-workspaces.html)

**Capabilities:**
Shared channels synchronize messages in real-time between separate Mattermost instances:

- **Real-Time Sync**: Messages, emoji reactions, and file sharing
- **Channel Types**: Support for public and private shared channels
- **Permission Control**: Each server maintains separate access controls
- **Participation Modes**: Read-only or full participation sharing
- **Advanced Features** (v10.10+): Direct messages between remote users, membership sync, remote user discovery

##### Resilient Federation for Joint Operations

Connected workspaces allow federated collaboration across multiple organizations and networks while maintaining local data control of each Mattermost deployment. Messages, threads, and files are securely synchronized between environments, ensuring mission continuity for multinational operations without requiring partners to join a single centralized deployment.

- Enforce zero-trust access and ensure that only authorized mission partners can view or contribute to shared collaboration channels.
- Configure auto-translation in shared channels for seamless multilingual cross-domain collaboration.
- Mattermost instances can operate independently during outages or intermittent connectivity and sync conversations once connectivity returns. For deployments in contested environments with limited connectivity, see [Air-Gapped Deployment](https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment-guide/server/air-gapped-deployment.html) guidance.

Many mission partners continue to operate on legacy systems such as Matrix and XMPP. To enable joint operations without forcing migration, Mattermost supports secure interoperability with these environments for continuity of coalition communications while allowing modernized workflows to extend across federated networks.

- Synchronize Mattermost channels with Matrix or XMPP rooms, allowing messages, threads, and attachments to flow across systems in real-time.
- Each organization maintains control of its data and infrastructure, while interoperability is enabled through federation bridges rather than centralized services.

##### Controlled External Access - Network Security Architecture

Mission partner collaboration may require involving external users such as allied forces, contractors, or coalition partners that do not have Mattermost deployments themselves. Guest accounts provide a controlled mechanism to enable these users to participate in joint mission operations while maintaining strict compliance and security boundaries.

- Guest accounts are restricted to specific teams and channels. This ensures external users only have access to mission-critical resources necessary for their role.
- Guests can be granted access to shared channels, enabling collaboration with additional trusted organizations through connected workspaces.

**Network Security Architecture**: When federating Mattermost instances across partner organizations, deploy Mattermost servers in a demilitarized zone (DMZ) network segment to provide controlled access while protecting internal network resources. This architecture provides defense-in-depth by isolating federation traffic from internal systems.

- **DMZ Deployment**: Position Mattermost application servers in the DMZ network segment, allowing both internal users and external partner federation traffic to access the collaboration platform through controlled network boundaries.
- **VPN Termination**: Terminate site-to-site VPN connections at the network perimeter or DMZ layer, enabling encrypted partner connectivity without exposing internal network infrastructure. VPN tunnels establish secure communication channels between partner organizations over the internet.
- **Firewall Segmentation**: Deploy ingress and egress firewall rules to control traffic flow between the DMZ, internal network, and external partner networks. Restrict database and object storage access to only originate from the DMZ segment where Mattermost servers reside.
- **Federation Traffic Isolation**: Partner federation traffic (Connected Workspaces synchronization over HTTPS port 443/TCP) remains isolated within the DMZ, protecting internal systems while enabling cross-organizational collaboration.

This DMZ architecture enables secure partner collaboration while maintaining network segmentation and enforcing zero-trust principles across organizational boundaries.

#### Matrix Federation

[Mattermost Matrix Bridge Plugin](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-matrix-bridge)

**Capabilities:**
Bidirectional communication between Mattermost and Matrix chat platforms:

- **Real Users**: Preserves authentic user identities, names, and avatars
- **Rich Content**: Syncs message formatting, mentions, threads, and file attachments
- **Emoji Support**: Over 4,400 emoji reactions synchronized
- **Message Lifecycle**: Handles edits, deletions, and reply threads
- **Security**: Prevents message loops and ensures proper authentication

#### Automatic Language Translation

[AI Auto Translations Plugin](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-channel-translations)

**Capabilities:**
Automatic message translation within configured channels:

- **Channel-Specific**: Translation enabled on per-channel basis
- **Multiple Languages**: Configurable target languages
- **User Preferences**: Individual users select their preferred language
- **Inline Display**: Translations appear seamlessly with original messages
- **AI-Powered**: Leverages Agents plugin with LLM backend

### Zero-trust Access Controls

Mission partner collaboration environments should adopt zero-trust principles by implementing attribute-based access control (ABAC) to ensure access to mission channels is governed by dynamic attributes such as role, clearance, location, and mission context.

- Restrict channel access based on user attributes rather than static groups.
- Continuously audit ABAC policies to ensure compliance with multinational operational and legal requirements.

### Sovereign AI - Detailed Implementation

AI capabilities enhance mission collaboration with summarization, translation, semantic search, and decision support. Sovereign AI ensures these capabilities remain fully under organizational control, without reliance on public cloud services or external data processing. Deploying AI in a self-hosted or compliance-approved environment enables secure, mission-ready augmentation.

- Deploy OpenAI-compatible language models on local or private cloud infrastructure to maintain data sovereignty and ensure offline availability.
- Configure custom agents for summarization, workflow automation, and decision support while enforcing organizational compliance policies.
- Enable multilingual collaboration in shared channels using sovereign AI services to provide real-time translations across partner organizations.
- Embed AI into operational playbooks for automated task execution, situational summaries, and proactive recommendations.
- Allow authorized users from partner organizations to securely access locally hosted LLMs through shared channels in connected workspaces.

### High Availability - Partner Network Specifics

Deploy Mattermost in a [cluster-based architecture](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration-guide/scale/high-availability-cluster-based-deployment.html) to ensure continued availability during outages or hardware failures. All cluster nodes must reside within the same datacenter to ensure optimal performance and consistent network latency. High availability requires redundant infrastructure across each critical component:

- **Application servers**: Scale horizontally across multiple nodes (64-bit x86 architecture) with a load balancer distributing client traffic. Servers communicate via gossip protocol for cluster coordination and leader election. All nodes must maintain identical `config.json` configurations and synchronized time via Network Time Protocol (NTP).
- **Database layer**: Use PostgreSQL master/read replica architecture with connection pooling and automatic failover. Configure read replicas to offload query traffic and search replicas for dedicated search operations. Optimize database connection limits, work memory settings, and autovacuum parameters for performance.
- **Object storage**: Configure S3-compatible backends with erasure coding or replication for durability. All application servers must access shared file storage (NAS or S3) to ensure consistent data availability.
- **Monitoring**: Deploy Prometheus and Grafana for comprehensive cluster health monitoring and performance metrics collection across federated partner networks.

**Cluster Operations**: Rolling updates can be performed for dot releases without service interruption. Configuration changes can typically be applied without full service restarts (server restart takes approximately 5 seconds; database schema updates may require up to 30 seconds). Use environment variables for configuration management and mmctl for cluster administration.
